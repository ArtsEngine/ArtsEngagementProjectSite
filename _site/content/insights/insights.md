# Insights and Results

Insights and results from this study draw from a variety of different analytical methods. Because the The Arts Engagement project is primarily a survey with many multiple choice options, there is a wide range of analyses and summary statistics for those responses. 

In addition to multiple choice questions, a set of open-ended questions built upon many of the multiple choice options, providing important insights into the diverse frames of students` experiences with the arts at UM and in their lives.
