<p><strong>Topic Model Results</strong> 
We estimated a topic model with 11 topics, 971 open-ended responses, and a 286 word dictionary. (after removing stop words). The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect two major topic branches: <strong>Self Fulfillment</strong> and <strong>Humanist Perspective</strong>. The detailed methods for estimating the model can be found in the section on <a href="../insights/analysis/topics.html">Topic Modeling and Interpretation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Representative Quotes</strong></p>
<p>*“Personally, it's made me see that it's a way to engage with people in a way I never would've thought. I am good at keeping to myself and being in my own little world, but music, arts, expression all help to connect people with one another and engage our emotions and passions.”</p>
<p>“I think that people are able to grow through the arts because it provides a needed outlet not only for personal expression of identity, values, and beliefs, but for connecting with one another. Arts are something that require no common language, experiences, or backgrounds, and people across communities can coexist and learn from one another through the arts.”</p>
