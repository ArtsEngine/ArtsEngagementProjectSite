<h1 id="Summary-of-Topics">Summary of Topics<a class="anchor-link" href="#Summary-of-Topics"> </a></h1><p>This question <em>“How did your involvement in the arts during college make you feel?”</em> was asked to elicit what the range of emotional responses to arts engagement in college might encompass for students. If the arts are an “expressive dialogue between the artist and the audience,” being able to articulate feelings associated with that engagement describes a whole universe of outcomes that may be associated with becoming more Enlightened. There are also negative emotions reported, such as being frustrated or discouraged, as art often deals with challenging subject matter, difficult mastery and technique challenges, and working with others under the conditions of fierce aesthetic direction and unrelenting deadlines.</p>
<p>Student respondents involved in the arts reported feelings of  being empowered and fulfilled, successful and accomplished, connected and culturally aware, happy and entertained, balanced and expressive, grateful and meaningful, and refreshed and less stressed.  There were also a large number of students who expressed some level of regret in having not participated in the arts in college to a greater extent.</p>
<h1 id="Enlightened">Enlightened<a class="anchor-link" href="#Enlightened"> </a></h1><p>Enlightened:  Having greater knowledge and understanding about a subject or situation</p>
<p>Synonyms:  informed, aware, educated, knowledgeable, learned, wise, literate, intellectual, tutored, illuminated, apprised, civilized, refined, cultured, cultivated, sophisticated, advanced, developed, liberal, open-minded, broad-minded</p>
<h2 id="Connected-and-Empowered">Connected and Empowered<a class="anchor-link" href="#Connected-and-Empowered"> </a></h2><p>Creating a sense of connectedness, and empowering students to feel accomplished and creative are among the major findings of this subnode of Connected and Empowered.  This topic also includes response categories where students recognize the value of arts engagement as an important stress reliever and as a way to better express themselves in a variety of settings.</p>
<h3 id="Connected-to-Others-through-the-Arts">Connected to Others through the Arts<a class="anchor-link" href="#Connected-to-Others-through-the-Arts"> </a></h3><p>In contrast to later nodes on this topic strand, Connected to Others through the Arts contains student responses that connect them less to specific peers or support systems, and more to the overall arts community on campus.  They appreciate and want to support the effort other students make in art-creation, and they are thoughtful about how they are connected to that community through their art-making or attendance.  This connection to their involved peers also inspires them to be more arts-focused, or discourages them through their own perceived deficiencies in the arts or creative endeavors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Representative Quotes</em></strong></p>
<p>*“Good, giving me more perspective and see what other people spend a ton of time doing . They work hard and it’s cool to see the final project, whether it's a performance or piece of art.”</p>
<p>“It makes me feel connected with the rest of the student body. I may not be able to personally work in some of the events that I attend, but I am able to understand and appreciate the amount of work and dedication that was put in by those who I observe. I m able to get an impression of the rest of my fellow students and of their work. My involvement also allows me to explore parts of my interests which are not purely academically related. Despite the fact that I am truly dedicated to what I do, the arts allow me to at least be interested in areas that I do not personally participate in.”</p>
<p>“It made me feel super connected to the world around me. Upon arriving, I gave myself the goal to attend at least one artistic show each week, and with all of the opportunities at Michigan, I was able to fulfill my goal. Attending these shows allowed me to become informed about all different kinds of art forms and it allowed me to understand my own art form further.”</p>
<p>“Like I was giving people the opportunity to express themselves.”</p>
<p>“Inspired, but almost discouraged also. I felt that I could never produce art as well or successfully as what I was seeing. Or discouraged that I did not even have the inspiration to produce something, even if I wanted to.”*</p>
<h3 id="Empowered">Empowered<a class="anchor-link" href="#Empowered"> </a></h3><p>The feeling of being Empowered through engagement in the arts was expressed by more than one-fifth of student respondents. Their arts participation in college made them feel Successful, Accomplished and Creative.  Choosing to engage in the arts also helped students to be Less Stressed and More Expressive.  Student respondents recognized the power of the arts in these areas, and knew they could use that power to improve themselves, their college experience, their future, and the world.</p>
<h4 id="Less-Stressed-and-More-Expressive">Less Stressed and More Expressive<a class="anchor-link" href="#Less-Stressed-and-More-Expressive"> </a></h4><p>Less Stressed and More Expressive, especially as a counterpoint to students’ academic pursuits, was a recurring theme.   As part of the Empowered subnode, these responses could also be viewed as students’ recognizing the value of the arts, as well as their agency in pursuing them,  as a means to stress relief.  Through arts engagement, students describe feeling less stressed, refreshed, better able to engage with new ideas and thinking, and able to apply more creativity and expressiveness to other areas of their lives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Representative Quotes</em></strong></p>
<p>*“It was a release and allowed for me to relieve my stress and tension from being in engineering classes only doing math and science problems all day. The arts allowed for me to add personality to my work.”</p>
<p>“I think my involvement has given me a much more open view of myself and the world, and has allowed me to express myself in different ways.”</p>
<p>“It allowed me to release stress from my classes and be more creative than most classes allow.”</p>
<p>“I'm a civil engineer and often spend the majority of my time thinking analytically and technically. My exposure to the arts has been a nice contrast, opening up my mind to a whole new way of thinking/expression.”</p>
<p>“Artistic and creative. Especially made me feel expressive in a different way than my everyday life. It was a wonderful way to escape and have fun escaping.”</p>
<p>“Being involved in the arts always leave me feeling refreshed and much more open-minded. It is a nice way to think outside of the classroom and develop opinions.”*</p>
<h4 id="Successful">Successful<a class="anchor-link" href="#Successful"> </a></h4><p>This area of topic responses focus on those feelings students associated with accomplishment, connectedness, pride, and creativity.  Excitement was also frequently expressed, as co-curricular engagement is often predicated on personal enthusiasm with the topic - in this case, with the arts.</p>
<h5 id="Proud">Proud<a class="anchor-link" href="#Proud"> </a></h5><p>It is interesting that student respondents in this topic area express that they feel both pride and frustration stemming from their engagement in the arts.  This may be because these two emotions are linked around the challenges that arts engagement engenders (time, skill, deadlines, creative conflict) creating an opportunity to succeed (creating pride in their work) - or fail (creating frustration).  The arts, like anything else when done well, require hard work, and often require the contributions of others.</p>
<p>Feeling Proud also lead to expressions of feeling special or unique, or to heightened personal connectedness which again highlights the student as an individual worthy of attention.  Connectedness in this node was more directly tied to peers and personal support systems rather than to the more abstract connectedness associated with the student body engaged with student in supporting the arts, society, or the global community as a whole (as in Connected to Others through the Arts).</p>
<p><strong><em>Representative Quotes</em></strong></p>
<p>*“Proud of what I created. It's rewarding to have physical evidence of your work.”</p>
<p>“It has made me feel just about every way I know how to feel. But mostly... frustrated!”</p>
<p>“Creative, excited, inspired, at peace, unique.”</p>
<p>“Good knowing I have a special creativity and others had their own too; a great supportive system.”</p>
<p>“Proud, something to look back on and feel that I did something that not many other people did. It is also impressive considering hundreds of people watched me on stage.”</p>
<p>“It made me feel important, as though my voice mattered and I could create things that I could look back on with pride. The evolution of my fiction writing is one of the most important things that's happened to me while at college.”*</p>
<h5 id="Accomplished-and-Creative">Accomplished and Creative<a class="anchor-link" href="#Accomplished-and-Creative"> </a></h5><p>As part of the Empowered stem, students responded with feelings of being both both Accomplished and Creative.  This pairing may be important in that responses in this area link students’ creative expression with accomplishment as a counter or complement to their academic achievements - indicating that it is their own judgement that renders the experience meaningful rather than other more typical college measures of success.  Students also reported that having a creative outlet improved or enhanced their academic experience, perhaps also adding to their sense of accomplishment through the arts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Representative Quotes</em></strong></p>
<p>*“I felt alive and accomplished”</p>
<p>“I felt accomplished and free to express myself void of judgement. I felt like it was more acceptable for me to sing like I want to (with effort and emotion) when I am playing guitar.”</p>
<p>“I feel very accomplished after I finish a creative project. I feel more connected to a creative project than I do when I study for an objective exam or finish some memorization homework. I feel like it uses more critical thinking, and I feel more connected to the project and I learn the material better.”</p>
<p>“Being involved in the arts during college has been an amazing outlet of creativity and passion for me; without it, my collegiate experience would have been reduced tremendously.”</p>
<p>“Empowered, creative, and encouraged that I don't have to give up art even if I'm busy with academic stuff.”*</p>

They also said they felt as though they belonged in more contexts - arts groups, social settings, and the greater community.  In addition, they saw this belonging and contribution an important part of something greater than themselves - either the creative enterprise in which they were engaged, or the greater ideas, culture, or community to which the arts contribute.</p>

Arts  engagement is also described as contributing to students’ “well-roundedness” because a large number of them receive little or no arts exposure through their majors or curriculum.  Students also reported that being engaged as an art-maker made them feel they were important in contributing to the arts-rich environment that had expanded them and, therefore, could expand others.</p>
