# Developmental Role

Students were asked ***“What role did the arts play in your development as a person, friend, colleague, and student during college?”*** This question addressed the role the arts played in relational terms – to self, and to self in interaction with others — but otherwise did not steer the topic areas of response. Responses regarding the self in interaction with others are present in this analysis as a subnode called **Social Connections**; here, developmental areas include new and strengthened social bonds, and supporting friends by attending and participating in arts activities. Under **Identity** development, students reported growth or change in the areas of personal identity, skill acquisition, new perspectives and cultural understandings, better life balance, and, as might be expected, a deeper appreciation of the arts.  Some of these impacts around development of self are related to the broader idea of **Social Identity**, and some are related to a different section of the topic analysis describing impact -  **Different Perspectives**. Notably, students did not report academic development specifically in this area – these kinds of impacts are expressed through other survey questions that are more specifically focused on on behavior and thinking.
