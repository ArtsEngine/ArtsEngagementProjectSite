# College Experience

***What role did the arts play in your college experience, both positive and negative?***

It is hard to imagine students describing a negative role for the arts in college, because even having encounters with challenging or disturbing topics through the arts would not be an unusual experience in other arenas as well (academic, social, interpersonal).  The best college experience, as a whole, is set up to educate, enrich, challenge and engage.  So it is not surprising that an overwhelming number of students (76%), report the Positive role the arts played in their college experience.

About 6% of students reported that they engaged in the arts primarily through their classroom experience (Educational), while one-sixth indicated that the arts played, at best, only a Small Role in their college experience (17%).  Even in these categories, the role of the arts in college was acknowledged as generally a positive one.

It is also important to note that there were some negative comments expressed by students about engaging in the arts in college - though these comments were often contained in a more overall positive response, or were used as a point-counterpoint in a response - making the response to be included in a positively labeled node somewhere in the narrative analysis. When students did indicate a negative role for the arts, it typically stemmed from either their frustration at not achieving as good grades or outcomes from their arts endeavors, the time the arts required adversely affecting their other coursework grades or focus, or that arts participation steered them to consider or choose what they perceived to be a potentially less secure or lower paying jobs in an arts field.
