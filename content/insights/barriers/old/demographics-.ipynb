    "In order to test for demographic patterns in the responses along each dimension, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey posthoc test to compare the principal component scores between demographic factor levels. Demographic variables that showed contrasts (Tukey adj.p.value < 0.05) between factor levels indicated differences that are unlikely to be due to chance. These differences may suggest an association between the direction of the demographic factors difference and the barriers described by the accompanying dimension/principal component.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed demographic factor level contrasts for Dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Dimension 3 (*Dialectical Complexity*) did not reveal any association with any of the demographic factors included in the analysis. There were 'school' and 'income' differences for Dimension 1. Differences for 'sex' emerged for Dimensions 2, 4, and 5. Prior exposure to the arts was particularly relevant for Dimensions 2 and 4.  \n",
