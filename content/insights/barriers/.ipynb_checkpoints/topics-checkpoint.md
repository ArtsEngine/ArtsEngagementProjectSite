# Summary 

We estimated a topic model using 3857 open-ended responses, resulting in a 537 word dictionary (after removing stop words) and a model with 24 topics. The detailed methods for estimating the model can be found in the section on [Topic Modeling and Interpretation](../insights/analysis/topics.html).

**University Context** responses are those that have a direct link to the environment at the University of Michigan, a large, highly selective 4-year college. Under **Social Climate**, students reported Apprehension over whether their ability or experience was sufficient to gain access to student arts groups or organizations, or whether the **Exclusiveness** of the audition process, the large U-M student talent pool, or the closed social groupings of student in the arts would conspire to keep them from a successful entry into organized and high level arts participation through primarily student organizations. There were also a number of barriers related to overall the **University Structure**, in both their academic programs (access and availability of courses they could take in the arts) and the lack of priority that was placed on the arts. Finally, U-M’s large decentralized campus environment made finding and accessing **Publicity** very difficult, frustrating students who felt it was a barrier that caused them to miss out on arts opportunities.

The **Priorities and Tradeoffs** node is fairly self explanatory, with **Academic Priorities** and **Time** being major (and likely expected) reported topic areas. The less reported **Logistics** node encompassed several more tangible barriers, such as **Distance Between Campuses** (time, convenience, transportation), **Cost**, and the **Friend/Cost Ecosystem** that describes not having peers with whom they can engage in arts events, so the **Cost** barrier, however that might be otherwise defined, was not overcome with an expected social outcome.

Students also described they were just **Not Engaged** around the arts, primarily due to **Lack of Personal Interest** or a sense of **Ennui**. There were also those who reported **No Barriers**, although often with the caveat that upon reflection they could report or imagine some potential barriers (**No Barriers, Except**).

# University Context

Under the major topic node of **University Context**, students reflected on their lack of confidence in their talent, knowledge, experience or technical abilities in the arts, which they believed would render them unable to participate in often highly competitive opportunities at U-M.  They also spoke to the difficulties in fitting demanding arts courses into their determined or inflexible schedules, the high bar of excellence required for entry into arts groups or programs, and the lack of emphasis the University puts on arts participation through its liberal arts requirements (i.e Creative Expression curricular breadth requirement).  Finally, finding information on arts offerings and events is difficult, leading to less participation than might otherwise be achieved.

## Social Climate

Student responses in the overarching node of **Social Climate** indicate they don’t participate in the arts as a result of a lack of confidence in their artistic abilities due to their current level of expertise, previous experience, or innate talent, especially as it relates to their peers who are involved in the arts.  Students also indicate that they feel they are not welcome in arts groups due to their new or lower skill levels or their “outsider” status. **Apprehension** and **Exclusiveness** are the descriptive labels of the two major topic categories in this node.

### Apprehension: Low Confidence and Lack of Familiarity

Responses around **Apprehension** relate to the student’s perceptions of their current abilities, experience, or personal traits in the arts as the impediment to their arts participation. Responses related to **Low Confidence** are typically about their perception that they are not as talented, “artsy,” experienced, or able to benefit from participation in the arts as other students who are participating.  As a large and elite institution, U-M draws a bigger pool of talented, arts-focused individuals, creating an entire category of students who would like to participate but believe they will be  “out-competed” for opportunities by others. This personal evaluation seems to discourage students from even attempting to participate. Responses in the **Lack of Familiarity** area address their desire to try something new in college, but not having the prior arts experiences that would make that possible.  Exposing that inexperience, or having it indeed shut a student out of participation, leads directly to students’ anxiety surrounding college arts participation.


### Exclusiveness: Competitive Auditions and Unwelcoming Environment

Responses under **Exclusiveness** relate to students’ perceptions of the lack of non-competitive arts entry points, existing social bonds that allow only certain students to gain access to opportunities, and the unwillingness for student art organizations to take on less experienced members who are looking for new or growth opportunities.  There is also a frustration reported in having tried to access opportunities multiple times, only to have experienced serial and discouraging rejections, or having to settle for less desirable options. **Competitive Auditions** are a fact of life in many arts activities, especially those in the performance areas.  This is a typical barrier for participation, but students report that in some instances, they present the only option for participation in their desired activity.  The high ability levels of peers competing for these opportunities is also a factor (See **Low Confidence**). Students report wishing there were more informal or broadly accessible opportunities for participation in the arts. In the **Unwelcoming Environment** category, students report on the social barriers in place and the judgement they perceived from those already involved with an arts activity.  Those who were already skilled and passionate were seen as unwelcoming to those who were new, less skilled, less committed, or non-arts majors.  Students reported feeling awkward or intimidated about interjecting themselves into an established “clique” or into arts “territory.” Finally, the expected level of engagement in arts activities was often too high for a more casual participant looking to experiment or just have fun.

## University Structure

**University Structure** refers to reported barriers such as those related to curriculum requirements, class scheduling, and major/minor programs; the lack of value, support or encouragement for engaging in creative or artistic endeavors; poor arts integration across disciplines; the controlled access to specialized major resources or facilities; the high rigor or access requirements for arts-related coursework and activities; and the general paucity of and long wait-lists for arts courses open to non-arts majors.  

### Academic Program Requirements

**Academic Program Requirements** are an arts participation barrier, with respondents citing arts-major programs not allowing access to non-majors who want to explore the arts - either through the addition of minors or by making it easy to select outside arts courses. Non-arts academic programs did not include the arts in their required coursework, or enough unstructured time to participate in extra-curricular arts activities.  Schools and colleges  in the arts did not increase the curricular arts options open to non-majors either because of enrollment restrictions or the limited number of courses offered.  Students also reported having to gain acceptance into specialized programs to access lab and studio equipment, which stymied their full arts ambitions.  Finally, the University did not encourage or prioritize robust arts participation through its limited Creative Expression requirements.

### University Priorities

Student experience what we are calling **University Priorities** as a barrier to their arts participation.  As a research university, there is little emphasis placed on creativity as a shared value and a desired outcome of student’s educational journey here.  This is evidenced by the perception that a majority of funding, attention and pride flows to business and engineering, versus, say, our top musical theatre programs - both from U-M and the State of Michigan. The small number of arts-related course offerings, each with long waitlists, would indicate the need for more such courses, but that is not viewed as a priority.  Engaging in arts activities, or anything that is not traditionally regarded resume-building, is discouraged.

### Departmental Segregation

Student respondents found that the **Departmental Segregation**--that is, not being allowed to enroll in or have ready access to arts courses offered outside their school, college or academic discipline--kept them from engaging in the arts at U-M.  There is a lack of access to studio space or resources for students not enrolled in specific arts programs or schools, and when enrolled in arts courses, the social isolation of being one of the only “outside” students in an arts course was uncomfortable. There were few “general” arts options for students wanting to explore, and without gaining access to highly competitive student arts organizations, there was an expressed fear that students would not have been able to participate in arts activities at all at college.



## Publicity

Student respondents expressed frustration with the difficulty in finding, obtaining and acting on information and **Publicity** around arts events and activities.  Having to actively look in multiple places for information, not receiving information in advance of events, and the sheer number of activities and events to sort through hampered their participation.  They also cited the geographic problems with the “split campus” from an information flow standpoint, as they perceived that many arts events occurred on the campus they were less likely to frequent.  Not being a member of a particular school or college also restricted access to information.  Finally, the arts were perceived as being less well-marketed to the students than other types of activities.

### Awareness

Not having a good **Awareness** of arts events and activities reportedly kept students from participating in the arts to the extent they would have liked.  Contributing to this barrier area was the lack of coordination between events organizers, calendars, and databases - there was not one good place to see the full picture of arts activities. Clear mechanisms to get both day-of and advance notice of events and activities was desired. Arts marketing efforts do not easily cross the campus divide, and there was a perception that arts activities and events were simply not as comprehensively marketed as other kinds of activities.

### Accessibility

Students reported needing to actively seek out information about arts events, creating **Accessibility** problems.  Not only is information hard to find, requiring real dedicated effort, but often very little information actually exists.  Conversely, so many seemingly similar choices made it hard to figure out what organization or activity might be right for those looking to participate.



# Priorities and Tradeoffs

In the node of **Priorities and Tradeoffs**, students cite their heavy Course Load as one of the greatest barriers.  They also state that the arts are not important enough to their majors or their careers to warrant participation. **Time**, **Distance Between Campuses**, and **Cost (Logistics)** were also major barriers. Finally, some students indicate they were just **Not Engaged** in the arts, or reported they had encountered few or **No Barriers** to participate at the level they desired. 



## Academic Priorities

In addition to the formidable barrier of Course Load, students also found it difficult to prioritize the arts because they were insufficiently connected to their majors, not offered or encouraged as a part of their coursework, or not obviously aligned with their career goals. 

### Fit With Major and Course Scarcity

Students respondents mainly reported difficulties in taking art courses outside their majors because there were few courses open to non-arts majors, and those that were were inaccessible due to few seats or the lack of space in a course schedule designed to fulfill requirements **(Fit With Major and Course Scarcity)**.  They were unsure how they might fit arts courses into their schedule and needed additional help to do so.  They also commented on needing to prioritize activities that more closely aligned with their career goals.

### Course Load

A large percentage of student respondents indicated simply and directly that their academic **Course Load** was too great (sometimes in conjunction with other more highly prioritized activities), to be involved in the arts at college.



## Time

Time was the single largest reported barrier cited by students, either that involved in participating in the arts activity itself, or in the logistical effort to do so (i.e. travel). They “could not do everything,” and the arts were sometimes cited as outside the students’ interest areas or priorities, as related to their free time.



## Logistics

Logistical considerations fill out the majority of this topic area, with students reporting difficulties with transportation,  the geographic locations of arts events, the cost of tickets (sometimes within the frame of cost/benefits, sometimes as a pure affordability concern), and the time or resources it takes to attend or participate.  Students also report wanting to go with friends to events, and speaking to the difficulties coordinating those efforts. 

### Distance Between Campuses 

The perception that North Campus is too far from Central Campus, where many arts activities occur, was noted as a barrier, and this “split campus” was a factor in learning about arts activities as well.  This is a barrier that might be unique to U-M, though this kind of campus “split” or geographic barrier to various kinds of participation is not uncommon at other institutions.  And although the regular bus  trips between the campuses are relatively short and convenient, weather, commute time, inconvenient activity scheduling, and the poor information flow between the campuses were contributing barrier factors.

### Cost

**Cost**, as expressed here in terms of personal affordability as well as a cost/benefit analysis, was not a large barrier, but an expected one for some students.  The arts were sometimes described as a luxury that was hard to justify against the perceived benefit of participation.  Students expressed a desire for access to more free high-quality events and activities, while acknowledging that those events have justifiable costs and value.

### Friend/Cost Ecosystem

The **Friend/Cost Ecosystem** topic respondents moved from reporting directly on value or affordability barriers to the desire to have U-M offer subsidies or strategies to work around financial constraints.  Students also indicated that their friends not attending (due to perhaps their own time and cost constraints) kept them from participating as well.

<!-- #region -->
## Not Engaged

Engaging in the arts in college is not a priority or interest area for every student, as should be expected **(Not Engaged)**.  Respondents in this topic listed a variety of personal reasons they were not engaged in the arts at U-M, including but not limited to lack of planning, lack of motivation, lack of art interests, lack of arts talent, and lack of previous exposure.  A percentage of students also indicated they experienced no reportable  barriers to participating at the level to which they had aspired.
