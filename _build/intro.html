<h1 id="The-Arts-Engagement-Project">The Arts Engagement Project<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Arts-Engagement-Project"> </a></h1><p>The Arts Engagement Project is a study of ~4000 undergraduate students at the University of Michigan that asked questions about the impacts, precursors, barriers, frequency, and perceptions of co-curricular arts engagement in college.</p>
<h2 id="Methods">Methods<a class="anchor-link" href="#Methods"> </a></h2><p>Drawing from a subset of open-ended questions and responses, we created ontological topic models for each question and an interactive decision support tool to facilitate collaborative interpretation of the topics. We also measured a variety of linguistic and psychographic factors associated with the responses using three different dictionary-based tools. We then combined these measures with the measures of topic prevalence in a principal components analysis to explore the relationships between the topics, tone, and structure of the responses.</p>
<h2 id="Implications">Implications<a class="anchor-link" href="#Implications"> </a></h2><p>The results — particularly when coupled with an analysis of their relationship the demographic profiles of the respondents — provided important insights for the design of arts-based experiences in higher education, as well as the impacts of the arts on student learning and engagement.</p>
<h2 id="Future-Project-Development">Future Project Development<a class="anchor-link" href="#Future-Project-Development"> </a></h2><p>This project studied only University of Michigan Students, but the study design and analysis methods could be used on other campuses to look at a broader range of students and their arts experiences. For instance, arts administrators in higher education may be interested in partnering with us, creating a larger network of research projects on this topic. We are currently documenting this project, describing the workflows used to develop the insights here, and possibly developing  an end-to-end workflow for quickly making sense of large collections of interviews, recording, or open-ended survey responses about emerging topics.</p>
<p>The results of this work have been used to add an array of categories of impacts to <a href="https://www.a2ru.org/projects/impacts-map/">A2RU's Impacts Map.</a></p>
