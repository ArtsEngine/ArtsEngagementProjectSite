<h2 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview"> </a></h2><p>We asked this question about barriers as a way to better understand — from a student’s perspective — what might keep them from engaging in the arts in college - either in general or to the degree to which they would have preferred. The question was open-ended so as not to presume to know how students would articulate the barriers. The expectation was that we would not to get a comprehensive laundry list of obstacles, just the ones that are most important to them.</p>

<li><p>Structural barriers imposed by disciplines, major, culture, and location are real and unevenly experienced.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Model Results</strong> 
We estimated a topic model with 24 topics, 3857 open-ended responses, and a 537 word dictionary (after removing stop words).</p>
<p>The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect two major topic branches: <strong>University Context</strong> and <strong>Priorities and Tradeoffs</strong>. The hierarchical tree visualization of topic nodes illustrates both curricular and co-curricular challenges.</p>

<h2 id="Summary-of-Topic-Analysis-Results">Summary of Topic Analysis Results<a class="anchor-link" href="#Summary-of-Topic-Analysis-Results"> </a></h2><p><strong>University Context</strong> responses are those that have a direct link to the environment at the University of Michigan, a large, highly selective 4-year college. Under <strong>Social Climate</strong>, students reported Apprehension over whether their ability or experience was sufficient to gain access to student arts groups or organizations, or whether the <strong>Exclusiveness</strong> of the audition process, the large U-M student talent pool, or the closed social groupings of student in the arts would conspire to keep them from a successful entry into organized and high level arts participation through primarily student organizations. There were also a number of barriers related to overall the <strong>University Structure</strong>, in both their academic programs (access and availability of courses they could take in the arts) and the lack of priority that was placed on the arts. Finally, U-M’s large decentralized campus environment made finding and accessing <strong>Publicity</strong> very difficult, frustrating students who felt it was a barrier that caused them to miss out on arts opportunities.</p>
<p>The <strong>Priorities and Tradeoffs</strong> node is fairly self explanatory, with <strong>Academic Priorities</strong> and <strong>Time</strong> being major (and likely expected) reported topic areas. The less reported <strong>Logistics</strong> node encompassed several more tangible barriers, such as <strong>Distance Between Campuses</strong> (time, convenience, transportation), <strong>Cost</strong>, and the <strong>Friend/Cost Ecosystem</strong> that describes not having peers with whom they can engage in arts events, so the <strong>Cost</strong> barrier, however that might be otherwise defined, was not overcome with an expected social outcome.</p>
<p>Students also described they were just <strong>Not Engaged</strong> around the arts, primarily due to <strong>Lack of Personal Interest</strong> or a sense of <strong>Ennui</strong>. There were also those who reported <strong>No Barriers</strong>, although often with the caveat that upon reflection they could report or imagine some potential barriers (<strong>No Barriers, Except</strong>).</p>
