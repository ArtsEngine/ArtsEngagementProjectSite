<blockquote><p>“The arts helped me grow as a person and a student. I developed much better time management skills as well as effective organization skills. I also became better at communicating and handling conflict between others. Additionally, my involvement in the art led to some of my closest friendships during college.”</p>
<p>“Helped me develop patience, creativity in my approaches to problems, ability to articulate ideas about aesthetic qualities, ability to be in conflict with a friend without it being destructive to our friendship, and a greater sense of my personal responsibility in group endeavors.”</p>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview"> </a></h2><p>This question asked about the role that the arts played in relational terms – to self, and to self in interaction with others. Broadly, these impacts around development of self fall along two main branches: <strong>Social Identity</strong> and <strong>Different Perspectives</strong>. The topic <strong>Social Connections</strong> indicated new and strengthened social bonds and supporting friends by attending and participating in arts activities. Students also reported growth or change in the areas of <strong>Personal Identity</strong>, <strong>Skill Acquisition</strong>, <strong>New Perspectives and Cultural Understandings</strong>, <strong>Better Life Balance</strong>, and, as might be expected, a <strong>Deeper Appreciation of the Arts</strong>. Tken together, this array of topics suggest a significant pro-social role for the the arts in the students' social (and skill) development.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Model Results</strong> 
We estimated a topic model with 10 topics, 812 open-ended responses, and a 322 word dictionary. (after removing stop words). The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect two major topic branches: <strong>Social Identity</strong> and <strong>Different Perspectives</strong>. The detailed methods for estimating the model can be found in the section on <a href="../insights/analysis/topics.html">Topic Modeling and Interpretation</a>.</p>
