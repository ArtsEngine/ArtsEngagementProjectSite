<p>A total of 27 variables and 3852 responses were included in the analysis of responses to the question,</p>
<blockquote><p>“What did you see as the barriers preventing you from being involved in the arts at the University of Michigan (if you experienced any)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five dimensions (components) explaining a cumulative 51% of the variation were extracted for further description.</p>

<p>This scree plot shows the explained variance of each of the dimensions and that illustrates the criteria used for selecting the number of dimensions to be studied. Eight dimansions had an eigenvalue greater than 1, explaining 64% of the variation among the responses.

<p>"Not enough time in my schedule to be in a club or group for pure enjoyment."</p>
<p>"From my perspectives, one of the major issues that is preventing me from being involved in the arts is time. I enjoy drawing, but I can never find the time to do so. There is just too much academic work. Another reason is that I am not an art major. There’s so many clubs/activities that I can participate and art is not being one of them. I am interested in majoring in computer science and I think that it would be better for me to participate in computer related clubs as opposed to art related clubs. However, if the time management situation wasn't a part of my issue, I would definitely take some art class or join clubs that will help improve my drawing skills."</p>
<p>"Not my major concentration so at times it was difficult to attend/participate in events because of time and schedule conflicts"</p>
<p>"Social cliques, lack of knowledge about what university resources to utilize and occasional university staff who made it clear they didn't see the point of my organization"</p>
<p>"The great and sad part of UM is the wealth of talented individuals who go here-- makes it hard for me, a moderately talented individual in a number of fields, to try out for a play or musical group and actually make it because I'm competing with, for example, percussion majors for Groove and theatre majors for a part in a play."</p>

<p>"It's difficult to find time to do art, I have too much schoolwork and the only way I can do art is if I incorporate it into my schoolwork. Another barrier is I'm get intimidated by other's arts, so I keep my art to myself most of the time."</p>
<p>"The main reason was I was not very involved in the arts while in college was that I became busy with things that do not often incorporate the arts. I am a mechanical engineering student which did not allow for much if any artistic components in my coursework, and at the same time do not think that I was surrounded by many class-mates who were interested in the arts. I also joined a social fraternity which emphasized aspects such as social, philanthropy, and sports, but overall was not an environment that emphasized the arts. I think that the barriers were therefore by personal choice and mainly due to incompatibilities with my activities."</p>
<p>"There are monetary costs for attending art events and performances, as well as other social group-based disparities. A lack of an academic focus in the arts, I think, may have limited my involvement in college as compared to high school where some art was required."</p>

There should be more opportunities to be parts of less intensive arts groups, if that is possible!"</p>
<p>"Not enough classes tailored for raw beginners. For example, if there had been free-hand drawing classes that were designed specifically for people who may not have nearly any experience with drawing (or who may not be very good), I would probably have takn one. Maybe these classes did exist, and I just didn't find them, but if that's true, the course guide should probably be more clear about which classes are for absolute beginners with very little experience or skill."</p>
<p>"Cannot find beginner art class (for nonmajors) that I could take"</p>
<p>"My major is in a non-arts field, and is not in LS&amp;A, which limits my exposure to and eligibility for participation in certain LS&amp;A activities."</p>
<p>"The theater scene is very limited to non-theater majors. Non-theater majors are rarely cast in any student productions and almost never in University Productions."</p>
<p>"Sometimes try-outs make it difficult for more novice dancers to get the experience they need to improve their skills. also, you must be a dance major to take upper-level dance classes, which is not fair."</p>
<p>"Stupid credit requirements. The school of music doesn’t realize the problems they have caused by requiring students to take Glee clubs for credits"</p>
<p>"Knowledge/awareness of groups, knowing how to join"</p>
<p>"Unawareness. People who live off-campus don't seem to be aware of a lot of awesome things/cultural/arts events."</p>
<p>"Lack of awareness. I find it easy to be involved in the Arts as an RC student. I find that many students don't know about the opportunities available like classes, clubs and events."</p>
<p>"Lack of awareness, and time conflicts with difficult classes. Availability"</p>
