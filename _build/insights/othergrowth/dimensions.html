Five components explaining a cumulative 51% of the variation were extracted for description.</p>

"Time schedule conflicting with class or other extracurriculars"</p>
<p>"Not enough time in my schedule to be in a club or group for pure enjoyment."</p>
<p>"From my perspectives, one of the major issues that is preventing me from being involved in the arts is time. I enjoy drawing, but I can never find the time to do so. There is just too much academic work. Another reason is that I am not an art major. There’s so many clubs/activities that I can participate and art is not being one of them. I am interested in majoring in computer science and I think that it would be better for me to participate in computer related clubs as opposed to art related clubs. However, if the time management situation wasn't a part of my issue, I would definitely take some art class or join clubs that will help improve my drawing skills."</p>
<p>"Not my major concentration so at times it was difficult to attend/participate in events because of time and schedule conflicts"</p>
<p>"Social cliques, lack of knowledge about what university resources to utilize and occasional university staff who made it clear they didn't see the point of my organization"</p>
<p>"The great and sad part of UM is the wealth of talented individuals who go here-- makes it hard for me, a moderately talented individual in a number of fields, to try out for a play or musical group and actually make it because I'm competing with, for example, percussion majors for Groove and theatre majors for a part in a play."</p>

<p>"As an engineer, I feel there could be more opportunities to get involved in the arts. I feel too intimidated by art majors or minors to take an art class for fun, which I otherwise would do."</p>
<p>"Fear of judgement"

<p>Principle Component 2: 
Other Interests (+)
Identified Barriers: Time, Major, Location, Cost (-)</p>
<p>Other Interests (+): Focus on self – pronoun ‘I’, Ennui, and No Barriers, except… 
personal narratives.
Lower status
Higher use of singular first person pronouns
(Kacewicz et al, 2013)</p>
<p>Identified Barriers: Time, Major, Location, Cost (-): Clout, Analytic, and relative all negative weighted. Clout is associated with status and lower use of first person pronouns</p>
<p>Analytic: Categorical language is a style that combines heightened abstract thinking (associated with greater article use) and cognitive complexity (associated with greater use of prepositions). (Pennebaker et al., 2014)</p>

<p>"Cost, time"</p>
<p>"Money, time"</p>
<p>"Do not have the time and I have other interests"</p>
<p>"No barriers. Just my other interests are higher than my desire to be involved in the arts most of the time"</p>
<p>"The only barriers I see is the impracticality of being involved in the arts as a pre-medical mathematics major."</p>

<p>"It's difficult to find time to do art, I have too much schoolwork and the only way I can do art is if I incorporate it into my schoolwork. Another barrier is I'm get intimidated by other's arts, so I keep my art to myself most of the time."</p>
<p>"The main reason was I was not very involved in the arts while in college was that I became busy with things that do not often incorporate the arts. I am a mechanical engineering student which did not allow for much if any artistic components in my coursework, and at the same time do not think that I was surrounded by many class-mates who were interested in the arts. I also joined a social fraternity which emphasized aspects such as social, philanthropy, and sports, but overall was not an environment that emphasized the arts. I think that the barriers were therefore by personal choice and mainly due to incompatibilities with my activities."</p>
<p>"There are monetary costs for attending art events and performances, as well as other social group-based disparities. A lack of an academic focus in the arts, I think, may have limited my involvement in college as compared to high school where some art was required."</p>

<p>"Cello difficult to take to rehearsal area all the way near Ebel Field"</p>
<p>"Distance - Especially in the winter. I live in Central Campus and the practices were held in North Campus at nights"</p>
<p>"It was always on central campus and I live more on the Hill part of campus so I wouldn't want to walk a distance at night just to go do something. I did however do stuff on my own at my apartment."</p>
<p>"Distance of home from campus. Commute time made it difficult to participate in student orgs/activities outside of class."</p>
<p>"The north campus/central campus thing. I feel like there is a great divide, and I often end up missing events that happen because I don't know about them"</p>
<p>"I feel that things either aren't very well advertised or advertised in such a way that doesn't feel accessible to someone who is not a member of the coordinating organization"</p>
<p>"Never really saw an opportunity."</p>
<p>"Lack of information, lack of enthusiasm from other students, lack of organization"</p>
<p>"Does not help me build my resume"</p>
<p>"I didn't experience any barriers, I just didn't have a very strong interest in the arts coming into college so I didn't choose to involve myself much in the arts."</p>
<p>"I'm not talented enough."</p>
<p>"Because I am not skilled in the arts. I feels as though I wouldn't be able to benefit in being a participant in the arts such as plays or visual art displays"</p>

<p>"There aren't a lot of arts opportunities (that I have been informed of) available for science majors or others who are not necessarily majoring or well-trained in arts but still do want to be involved. For example, I am a Neuroscience major, but I enjoy creating visual art and have recently gotten involved in graphic design to promote a non-arts club I am in. There should be more opportunities to be parts of less intensive arts groups, if that is possible!"</p>
<p>"Not enough classes tailored for raw beginners. For example, if there had been free-hand drawing classes that were designed specifically for people who may not have nearly any experience with drawing (or who may not be very good), I would probably have takn one. Maybe these classes did exist, and I just didn't find them, but if that's true, the course guide should probably be more clear about which classes are for absolute beginners with very little experience or skill."</p>
<p>"Cannot find beginner art class (for nonmajors) that I could take"</p>
<p>"My major is in a non-arts field, and is not in LS&amp;A, which limits my exposure to and eligibility for participation in certain LS&amp;A activities."</p>
<p>"The theater scene is very limited to non-theater majors. Non-theater majors are rarely cast in any student productions and almost never in University Productions."</p>
<p>"Sometimes try-outs make it difficult for more novice dancers to get the experience they need to improve their skills. also, you must be a dance major to take upper-level dance classes, which is not fair."</p>
<p>"Stupid credit requirements. The school of music doesn’t realize the problems they have caused by requiring students to take Glee clubs for credits"</p>
<p>"Knowledge/awareness of groups, knowing how to join"</p>
<p>"Unawareness. People who live off-campus don't seem to be aware of a lot of awesome things/cultural/arts events."</p>
<p>"Lack of awareness. I find it easy to be involved in the Arts as an RC student. I find that many students don't know about the opportunities available like classes, clubs and events."</p>
<p>"Lack of awareness, and time conflicts with difficult classes. Availability"</p>
