<p>There are close to over two dozen different analyses being conducted on this dataset. The results posted here represent a small subset, and many analyses are ongoing in various stages of completion. Rather than waiting for all of the results to be finalized, we are posting the most up-to-date results here — as time and resources permit us to analyze, interpret, and report on the results.</p>

<p>This study draws from a variety of analytical methods. In addition to multiple choice questions, a set of open-ended questions builds on the multiple choice responses and demographic profiles — providing important insights into the diverse frames of students` experiences with the arts at UM and in their lives.</p>
<p>Available or in-process results from the open-ended question responses are highlighted below and linked to their respective pages. These results — particularly when analyzed in conjunction with demographic factors — begin to provide important insights for the design of arts-based experiences in higher education, as well as the impacts of the arts on student learning and engagement.</p>
