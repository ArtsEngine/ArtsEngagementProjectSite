<h1 id="Insights-and-Results">Insights and Results<a class="anchor-link" href="#Insights-and-Results"> </a></h1><p>Insights and results from this study draw from a variety of different analytical methods. Because the The Arts Engagement project is primarily a survey with many multiple choice options, there is a wide range of analyses and summary statistics for those responses.</p>
<p>In addition to multiple choice questions, a set of open-ended questions built upon many of the multiple choice options, providing important insights into the diverse frames of students' experiences with the arts at UM and in their lives.</p>
