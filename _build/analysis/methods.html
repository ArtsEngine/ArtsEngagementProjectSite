<li><strong>Collecting the Data</strong>. Jupyter Book expects a particular
collection of files and folders that work with the Static Site Generator
Jekyll. The <a href="01-5_tour.html">anatomy of a Jupyter Book</a> section covers the
general structure of Jupyter Books, and the <a href="02_create.html">create your book template</a>
guide shows how to create your own book structure.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning the resulting data</strong>. We first create each page of
your book into HTML. This converts your <code>.ipynb</code>, <code>.md</code>, etc files into HTML
that can be understood by a website. It also uses your book's metadata to insert
tags and other layout elements into each page's HTML. See the <a href="03_build.html">building each page's HTML</a>
section for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>. Once we have HTML for each page, we
can stitch them together for a book. At the end of this step, you should have
standalone HTML that can be hosted online. See the <a href="publish/book-html.html">build your book's html</a>
section for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Host your book's HTML online</strong>. Once your book's HTML is built, you can host
it online as a public website. This guide <a href="04_publish.html">covers a few ways to do this</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To begin, check out the next section. You can follow this guide linearly, or use it as
a reference later on.</p>
<p>Now that you've got a Jupyter Book folder structure, we can create
the HTML for each of your book's pages. That's covered in the next
section.</p>
